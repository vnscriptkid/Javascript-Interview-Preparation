#### localStorage
- ✔️ Persist user state across refreshes, tab closings, browser closings
- ✔️ Can be sent across domain (SPA app vs API)
- ⚠️ Vulnerable to Cross-site scripting attack

#### Cookie
- Flow
  - Server tells client (browser) to set cookie
  - Since then, for every reqs sent by browsers to server (it attaches cookie data in headers)
- `document.cookie`
- By setting `http=true`, means this piece of data can only sent by browsers (not javascript)
- ⚠️ Can't be sent across domain (even same domain but different ports)
