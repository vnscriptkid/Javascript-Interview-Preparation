- What? configure how the DI Framework should resolve the dependencies
- Resolution Modifiers: modify the behavior of injectors

## DI process
* :one: ❓ component asks for Dependency
* :two: 🕶️ look for the Dependency in the current component's `ElementInjector`
* :three: 🧗 Climb up the component tree, until root `ElementInjector`
* :four: 👓 looks for the Dependency in the `ModuleInjector`
* :five: ☠️ Throw an error

## `ViewChild()`
* query a single DOM element from the DOM tree and lets you manipulate it
```js
<my-custom-component #reference></my-custom-component>

@ViewChild('reference') myComponent;
```
